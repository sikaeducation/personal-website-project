# Personal Website Project

Your task is to build a website demonstrating your skills and creativity. It will contain a self-profile, an example of something you like to create, and evidence of how you sought and incorporated feedback.

## Site Requirements

Your website should contain 3 linked pages:

### About You

This page should contain 3 elements:

1. A picture of yourself
2. 1 paragraph about your background
3. 1 paragraph about why you want to be a software engineer

### Creative

This page should contain details about something you like to create. You can make this about anything,but here are some ideas:

* Recipes
* Crafts
* Songs
* Dances
* Creative Writing
* Videos

The page should include pictures and descriptions. These can be written as a tutorial, a showcase, a tour, or anything else that gives insight into your creation and your process.

### Revisions

This page should contain details about how you've changed this site in response to feedback you've solicited from others. You may include as many revisions as you like, but you should have at least one and it should include:

* A screenshot of what your site looked like before you revised it
* Who you talked to and what feedback they gave you
* A screenshot of what the site looked like after you incorporated the feedback

### Deployment

This site should be deployed to the web and available through a public URL. You may use any provider you like, but here are some recommendations:

* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/products/)
* [Surge](https://surge.sh/)

Note that you are not required to use Git or GitHub for this project, but you may find that they make deployment significantly easier.

## Deliverable

* The URL of your deployed personal website
